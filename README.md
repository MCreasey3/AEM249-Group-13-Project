# AEM249-Group-13-Project
Holds my CPP file for our AEM 249 Group Project in Spring 2021. 


This program is a simple text-based C++ file designed to calculate drag on a number of aircraft, at any given airspeed. The user has the optiom to select from 5 aircraft with predetermined values for wing (reference) area and their drag coefficient. 

In addition, the user is able to input their own data for a "custom" aircraft using specifications that they choose.
